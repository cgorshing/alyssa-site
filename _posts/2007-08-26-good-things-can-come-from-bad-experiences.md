This weekend hasn&#8217;t been the best of weekends. We have started Alyssa on her training/exercies along with putting an eye patch on for three hours a day. Although today was better than yesterday, she still cries and gets upset with her patch. So far she seems to handle it well for about one hour, that seems to be her threshold limit.

We did go by Walgreens to look if they had any other eye patches, they did have a $3 one which is slightly different than the one the doctor gave us. We went ahead and bought just to see if Alyssa would like it any better. Even though it seems to fit her face a little better, the strap is a little tighter and pushes her glass against her face more. We have to put the patch on the outside of her glasses because she must keep her glasses on 100% of the time, and the glasses do not fit at all when they are put on top of the patch.

They did have a band-aid type patch which doesn&#8217;t seem to be too sticky. Alyssa seems to like this a little better, she doesn&#8217;t complain (too much) about any pain.

As a family we haven&#8217;t prayed too much together in the past. On occasion we will say a prayer during supper time, but that is the limit of our praying. We started tonight on making it nightly item to do together. Christian, Paige, and myself said a prayer out loud, but Alyssa said she couldn&#8217;t think of one to say. But as I was kissing Paige goodnight, I heard Alyssa say a small one

&#8220;Dear Jesus, please come help me with my eye so I could see better, amen&#8221;
