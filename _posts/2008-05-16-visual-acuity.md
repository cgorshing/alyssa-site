This [post][1] is the last time I have given an update on Alyssa&#8217;s VA. We were told two weeks ago at our normal appointment her VA was tested but there wasn&#8217;t any noticeable progress. We were given an update just last week that I thought I would share with you.

Alyssa has more of a difficulty seeing letters all ran together, this stems from the [ambloypia][2] she has (remember this is just one of the five things wrong with her left eye). The problem is the letters get kind of smudged together and it is difficult for her to distinguish between them. So with a line full of letters she was able to get to 20/70, which is better than previously stated.

The excellent thing is with a single letter at a time she is able to get to 20/40. Needless to say this makes Christian and I extremely happy. I was proud of Christian though; she was able to maintain her composure until we got outside of the doctors office (just to be fair, it took me a few hours before I couldn&#8217;t contain my joy and had to let it out). If you recall she started out at 20/400. To state once again, these measurements are with her glasses on, not with them off.

On her 20/20 walk away exercise she is still staying around 8ft (a little more sometimes), but she is able to read the letters quicker than she was in March. So during the five minutes we perform the 20/20 walk away exercise she is able to read around 10-14 letters instead of the 4-5 she was reading in March.

One last note &#8211; all last week Christian and I were praising her a lot and one night she did really well on 20/20 walk away. Christian and I (again) praised her for her hard work and told her how proud we are of her. Her remark was priceless &#8211; &#8220;God did it mommy.&#8221;
