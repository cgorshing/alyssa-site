My apologies for not posting an update, I have nothing but excuses.

On Sept. 14, the nurse let us know that Alyssa&#8217;s eye sight has improved. When we first began our journey a couple months back her vision in her left eye, with glasses on, was 20/300. This is worse than legally blind (which is 20/200). In case you are not aware, as I was, of what these numbers mean they basically say that at 20 feet away from Alyssa she can see things that a normal person can see at 300 feet away. I digress, her vision now is at 20/200. Christian and myself were extremely happy to have a little bit of good news.

On Sept. 21 &#8230; well maybe it is time for a little background. Hopefully we have all played around with 3D books before. Were you had to use special glasses with, usually, a blue lens for one eye and a red lens for the other eye. If you ever tried to close one of you eyes, you didn&#8217;t get the 3D feel and it looked totally different. Well this is very similar to how the doctor can check to see how well Alyssa&#8217;s eyes are working together. Once they start working together she can see things in a different way than she has historically. I do not know too much about one of these tests they perform on her, but there is something dealing with a spinning disc. She has not been able to see it up until this day. The nurses were pretty excited that when they asked her if she saw anything, she replied &#8220;I see something spinning&#8221;. The nurses were excited, but nowhere as excited as Christian and I. You better believe it that we went and ate some ice cream after that visit.

On Sept. 28 we had another good visit. But I would like to tell you how disgusted I am with other parents in this world. I know this isn&#8217;t very christian like, but I am appalled at the number of parents who will make excuses for their children and put the blame on other things and/or other people. Other parents have had numerous excuses for their child not wearing glasses, not wearing the patch for three hours a day, not performing the excises well, and not doing the exercises at all. I am at a lost for words on how upset this makes me. But back to our situation &#8230; the nurse didn&#8217;t have a whole lot to say but we picked up another exercise. I asked if the other exercises were not working or causing problems (in case you do not know me too well, I tend to be a pessimistic), the nurse informed us she was finally able to perform this new exercise where she wasn&#8217;t able to previously. So another good sign of progress &#8230; no, we didn&#8217;t get Braums on this visit, we went and bought some big pretzels at the mall.

While typing out the previous paragraph it made me think back a little over a year ago. I was tucking Alyssa into bed and she let me know that &#8220;Daddy, you have a a big belly&#8221;, &#8220;Thanks sugar&#8221; I replied basically shocked. And then she said while stretching hers arms as far apart as she could &#8220;It&#8217;s huuugggeee&#8221;. I kind of stumble on how to respond to such a compliment, and then she said the kicker &#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s big like a pretzel&#8221;. Pretzels have never been the same.
