Alyssa has always liked playing hide and go seek. On Tuesday of this week I thought she came up with a pretty good hiding spot. I looked in her room and didn&#8217;t see her, so I went to our other rooms before I finally figured out where she was at &#8230; honestly though, I found her because of her giggling.

This is [where she was at][2].
