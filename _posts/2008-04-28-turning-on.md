I haven&#8217;t written much lately. This is due to the fact Alyssa hasn&#8217;t changed much on her exercises or on the progress.

I have mentioned previously on how Alyssa&#8217;s left eye is basically &#8216;off&#8217; when she does not have her patch on, that the brain is choosing to turn it off because it can not use it. In Feb. when talked with her doctor, he told us that her eye is starting to flash on.

Recently I have started playing around with her on hopes of getting her eye to come on more. She can tell when this happens because she sees two of everything (double vision &#8211; remember her brain isn&#8217;t able to use both eyes together, so they are looking at different places). In the last two weeks she has started telling me when she sees two of things, typically this happens at school.

Just last night I was messing around with her and got her eye turned on (I can tell because her left eye will become straight). I played with her for roughly 20 minutes and her eye still stayed on. It was bedtime so I had to stop.

Hopefully her eye will continue to kick on more often.
