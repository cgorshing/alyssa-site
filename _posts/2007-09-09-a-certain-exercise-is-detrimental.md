One of Alyssa&#8217;s exercises is to read numbers (if possible) from a sheet of paper. These look like regular telephone numbers in roughly 16pt. size font. She uses [special glasses][1] in addition to her normal glasses. I hold these special ones right up against her normal glass, they alter the magnification just slightly. She is suppose to read the numbers once they are clear and following that I am suppose to flip the glasses (again, I only flip the glasses when the numbers are clear). Initially when we started this exercise they just had her color, which she really enjoys doing. After a week of coloring they gave us the numbers (&#8216;they&#8217; being the nurses), they told us that if she can&#8217;t get the numbers then it would be okay to go back to coloring. So that is what we have been doing; starting out with the numbers for about one minute, then finishing up with coloring &#8230; since she could never read the numbers.

Our last visit on Friday the 7th, the nurse stressed the point of how important it is for her to be able to read the numbers, and &#8220;it would be detrimental if she can&#8217;t accomplish this&#8221;. That got Christian and I a little scared because we knew how difficult she is having reading the numbers. All the previous times on that exercise Alyssa almost gets depressed because she is unable to read them. Last night, Sept. 8th, I didn&#8217;t even flip the glasses in the five minute span because Alyssa said they were never clear.

Just a few minutes ago we did our exercises, and Alyssa started to read a number right off the bat. I stopped her thinking that she had memorized the first set of numbers. I asked if they were clear, and she replied &#8220;I can see them, they are clear &#8230; kindof&#8221;. At this point, I am tickled pink with a &#8216;kindof clear&#8217; response.

I continued on with numerous other numbers and she was about 40% correct on the numbers. That is kicking butt awesome compared to the 0% previously.

I hope this pattern continues, and I hope she is actually beginning to see things slightly better and that she isn&#8217;t just pulling my leg &#8230; which she is good at doing to me &#8230; what can I say, I&#8217;m a big gullible fool for my girlie&#8217;s.
