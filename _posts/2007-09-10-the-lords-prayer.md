Last night the girls and I sat down to pray (Christian is in Dallas for some training), I said a little prayer to watch over mommy as she is away and asked Alyssa is she had a prayer she would like to say. &#8220;The Lunch Prayer&#8221; was her reply, Paige let her know that it is called &#8220;The Lord&#8217;s Prayer, not Lunch&#8221;. Alyssa replied &#8220;ooohh&#8221;.

I had a hard time trying not to laugh.
