As of last week our journey is over. Alyssa has come a tremendous distance and accomplished wonderful things.

Christian and I are very grateful for everything our friends and family have done for us, and we wanted to extend our appreciation for you all.

Alyssa&#8217;s eye sight is still not 100%, but most of the time both of her eyes focus on the same thing and her VA in her left eye is staying pretty solid at 20/30. Unbelievable.

It has already been a strange adjustment getting back to so-called &#8216;normal&#8217; as it seems strange not having to worry about patching her right eye for six hours a day and also not to worry about doing exercises. Dr. White does not want us to do anything with her eye anymore. Instead of a yearly eye checkup with her normal eye doctor, we will schedule it at a six month interval. We will also stop in Dr. White&#8217;s office for a checkup from time to time as well. But he does not expect anything to regress (God willing). As a parting gift they gave Alyssa the [Junie B. Jones Is a Graduation Girl][1] book and everybody who had worked with her signed it.

This will probably be my last post for some time. Once again, Christian and I are extremely blessed to have the friends and family in our lives.

Thank you all
