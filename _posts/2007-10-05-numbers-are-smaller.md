Today we have some more good news. The size of the [numbers][1] in one of her exercises has been decreased starting today. This, of course, is a good thing. We don&#8217;t have much any other information, they tested her [VA][2] again today and it hasn&#8217;t changed. But for the fourth week in a row we have received good news from the doctor.

All is well in the house of the Gorshings.
