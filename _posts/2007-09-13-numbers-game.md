Just a quick update tonight. As I have previously mentioned, Alyssa being able to [read numbers with special glasses][1] is very important to her training. Well tonight, she read eight sets of numbers without making a mistake. Although she does hold the paper very close, it is tremendously better than what she was doing just six days ago.
