Trying to play catch up here &#8230;

  * We have gone back to the smaller numbers which she reads with the glasses.
  * We have picked up a new exercise, the 20/20 walk away. This is a piece of paper which is used to test people for 20/20 vision. She started out being able to read the letters at 3.5 ft, we have now worked our (or should I say her) way back to 8ft 9in.
  * The time she is wearing her patch has been increased from 3 hours to 6 hours. Big sister is helping us out a lot in ensuring this happens (Alyssa has to wear it at her day care &#8230; luckily no kids have ridiculed her).
  * The games we play are mostly [Perler Beads][1] which the doctors office says is a fantastic thing to work with her. She is also playing games on the computer, most notably is www.webkinz.com &#8230; this has a lot of games where Alyssa has to concentrate on smaller objects and click on them (plus they have addition and subtraction games).

We have been given two pieces of some very good new. First off is the doctors office told us that Alyssa is starting to use her [macula][2], for those of you who do not know what this means &#8230; well &#8230; it is a **huge** deal and accomplishment. The other piece of good news is that starting at the first of January they are planning on working with Alyssa to get both of her eyes working together as a team.

Christian and I are extremely excited about how far she as come and the progress she has made.
