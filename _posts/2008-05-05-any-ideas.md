Nothing new to report, Alyssa is holding her own pretty good.

I wanted to ask any of you to either email me (of course phone calls work too) or post a comment to this post as to what ideas you would have for her to play with to help out her eye.

We have just bought a [Lite Brite][1], which she is really liking. We also have bought her the [Perler beads][2], which she likes also. The other thing I bought her was a beginners loom. But this was pretty hard for me to handle (which isn&#8217;t saying much), so I haven&#8217;t let play with it too much.

So if you have any ideas of toys/games which would deal with smaller items, or paying attention to details &#8230; please let us know.
