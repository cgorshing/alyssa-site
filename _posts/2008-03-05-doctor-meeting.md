This past week, Christian and I were able to have another sit down (one-on-one &#8230; err &#8230; I guess one-on-two) with Alyssa&#8217;s doctor. I have mixed feeling about the meeting, but things are progressing. Not at the rate we would like, but still progressing nonetheless. The strangest thing he told us is to not take the home exercises as an indication of well she is progressing along or doing. He said that a lot of times, kids will not do as good at home because of motivation, sickness, tired, or just plain stubbornness.

He did mention he wanted to get Alyssa back to the regular eye doctor and get a checkup done for her vision and to possibly (hopefully) get a better prescription for her glasses. He let us know that her VA is still at 20/100, and that hopefully after she gets her new prescription, it might be a little better.

The normal eye doctor appointment was this morning and we are glad to say she was able to see 20/80 with the equipment at the normal eye doctor (optometrist I guess I should be saying). So Christian and I are extremely excited for her new glasses and prescription to get here next week, hopefully this will help get things moving again.
