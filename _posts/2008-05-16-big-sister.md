I don&#8217;t write all that often on how much Paige has helped us out and I would like to take a minute and be a proud paw-paw.

<!--more-->

Paige has done wonderfully with helping out with Alyssa. We usually drop the girls off at day care a little after 7am (we have Alyssa&#8217;s eye patch on before we leave the house), and the girls ride the bus from there at 8am. Shortly before the bus arrives, Paige helps Alyssa take her patch off and makes sure her patch is in Alyssa&#8217;s backpack. After they get back to day care around 4pm, Paige helps Alyssa get her patch back on. We have been doing this since August and I believe there has been two days when Paige forgot to put Alyssa&#8217;s patch on. This means a tremendous amount to Christian and myself; we are extremely proud of both our girls.

Paige also works with Alyssa on reading, LiteBrite, Chess, and a few other games.

I just wanted to let everybody know that we were not leaving out Alyssa&#8217;s big sister &#8211; she plays an extremely large role in helping us be successful with Alyssa.
