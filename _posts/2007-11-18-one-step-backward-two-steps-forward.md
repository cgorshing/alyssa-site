Had a decent visit at the doctors office on Friday. They let us know that she tested at 20/100, if you will recall [last time][1] she was at 20/200. They also had us stop doing one of her exercises. So that is good progress.

But the exercise of reading the numbers with the special glasses, we were given a larger sheet than what we had before. The reason is that Alyssa is having a too hard of a time reading the smaller numbers. We have an appointment on Tuesday to discuss with the doctor what all is going on. Another thing they are having us do is increase the time she has her patch on. We use the patch for three hours everyday, and now they want to use it for six hours. They told us they are wanting to try and speed it up so Alyssa won&#8217;t have to use the patch anymore.

I don&#8217;t know what they are looking for, but hopefully we will have more questions answered on Tuesday.
