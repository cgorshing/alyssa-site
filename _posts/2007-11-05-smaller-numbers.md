Our appointment on Friday was pretty good. The nurse didn&#8217;t have a whole lot to add. We haven&#8217;t changed (added or removed) any exercises, however, the phone numbers she reads for one of her exercises is smaller now. This size of the font of this new sheet we were given is about the size of the font on a sales receipt. She has a really hard time reading the numbers, the last sheet she could read about 10 &#8211; 14 numbers within 5 minutes. And now with this new sheet she is reading about 4 &#8211; 5 numbers in a minute span.

She reads these numbers with those [special glasses][1] as I have mentioned before. She seems to have an easier time with smaller font close up than with larger sized font further away.
