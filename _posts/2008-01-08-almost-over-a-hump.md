We might be getting closer to getting over a hump. We were told last week at our doctor&#8217;s visit they are almost to the point of getting Alyssa to work with both her eyes together.

Alyssa did really good on Sunday with her *20/20 Walk Away* exercise, she passed her old record of 105&#8243; and hit 117&#8243; which is 3 inches shy of 10ft.

The past week I have noticed her looking around or over her glasses instead of through her glasses, she does this only when her patch is on. This has not been an issue previously and I am curious of what the problem is. She is aware she is doing this (she apologizes to me when I catch her doing it), and says she can see much better without her glasses. I have talked to the nurse about this and hopefully we will have an answer this coming Friday.
