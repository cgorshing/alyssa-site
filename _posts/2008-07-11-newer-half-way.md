As I mentioned in my previous post, Alyssa has surpassed the half way mark.  We test Alyssa on a 8.5&#8243; x 11&#8243; piece of paper.  This has about 6 columns and 10 rows of letters, with many of them repeated.

Even though Christian and I were extremely happy, we wanted to make sure Alyssa wasn&#8217;t just memorizing the location of the letters.  So Christian created another sheet and tried to match the font, size, and style of the sheet given to us by Dr. White.  We took the sheet to our weekly appointment just so we have their blessing on using it, which we received.

Alyssa did have a hard time to start off with, getting around 8ft. her first time.  But once she realized all the letters are different and she has to try a little harder, she is back over 10ft. again.

So once again Christian and I are happy with her progress and we have proof Alyssa is not cheating, but is really past a half way mark.
