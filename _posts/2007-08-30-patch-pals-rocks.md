When we all got home from work we had a package from [PatchPals][1]. Evidentally, Aubrey (AJ) and Misty bought it for us and had it mailed directly to us.

Christian and I would love to tell them we appreciate the gift so much. The picture below shows how much Alyssa liked it as well, this was right after I had put it on her.</p>
