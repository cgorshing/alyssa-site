We have taken a couple steps backward this past week &#8230; literally. On the 20/20 walk-away exercise Alyssa is back to 7-8 ft. She used to be around 5-6ft, so I think her new glasses are helping out a little bit.

One thing some of you may not be aware of is Alyssa&#8217;s left eye is basically &#8216;off&#8217; when she does not have her patch on. I explained this a little better in my previous post. I have tried to explain this to her and she is beginning to tell me when she sees two of things. This is when both eyes are on but unable to focus together on the subject. I really do hope she is telling the truth and not just making something up because she knows that is what I want to hear. Time will tell I guess. No new exercises this week, we still have the 20/20 walk-away, TV Trainer, Pencil Pursuits, and Temporal Excursions.

One of the neat things I was told about was last Sunday (a week before Easter). I stood up in church to give my thanks and joys about Alyssa&#8217;s progress, following church a lady approached me asking more about Alyssa&#8217;s condition. She asked if Alyssa had [amblyopia][1], this is one of the five things Alyssa has wrong with her eye. I informed her it was and we got to talking about the different exercises to help cure it. She couldn&#8217;t believe so many of the exercises had changed since her daughter went through the same thing years ago. I inquired as to the age of her daughter and was told she is 50 years old. The lady informed me her daughter was basically cured of the problem and is able to drive without any problems. She also said they started working with her daughter when she was just six years old. I hope we have the same success story to tell one day.
