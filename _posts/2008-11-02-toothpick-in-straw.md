When all goes well I find it extremely easy to praise and brag about the progress Alyssa has made. But when she doesn&#8217;t do all that well, I don&#8217;t seem to speak up as much; in that regard I apologize for not posting anything in almost two months.

Alyssa did regress quit a bit, we aren&#8217;t sure why this happened but it did and we are dealing with it. I won&#8217;t get into the details of taking steps backward, but rather to focus on the brighter side of things.

The one thing I would like to say publicly is my appreciate of my in-laws. On Sept. 27th Christian&#8217;s family had a get together for her grandmothers 80th birthday. We all had fun riding a go-cart, throwing a football, shooting a bow and arrow (I thought I lost an arrow, but Paige found it for me), singing some horrible karaoke (well, the bad part was due to me), and some good pork tenderloins.

Near the end though, we all came together and prayed for Alyssa. Shannon McAbee was nice enough to say a few nice things since I was unable to contain my composure. We all [laid hands][1] on her with Olive Oil and prayed. I truly appreciate everybody participating in it, that meant a tremendous amount to both Christian and I.

Along those same lines, a few weeks ago we were in [City Bites][2] (a sandwich place in Okla.) eating lunch on Saturday. The girls got up to refill our drinks and a customer noticed Alyssa&#8217;s patch, he stopped Paige and asked what was wrong with Alyssa&#8217;s eye. While he and his wife were leaving they stopped by our table and the gentleman struck up a conversation with Alyssa. Now most of you know Alyssa is not an outgoing type person and I was just so proud of her that she actually answered his questions. The quick conversation the gentleman and Alyssa had is as follows:

Gentleman: Do you believe in Jesus?  
Alyssa: Yeah.  
Gentleman: Do you believe that he can do all things?  
Alyssa: Yes.  
Gentleman: Would you like to hold my hand and pray with me?

Alyssa didn&#8217;t say anything, she looked up at me and Christian for acknowledgment, and after we told her it was okay, she took his hand and he began to pray for her.

I hadn&#8217;t ever had something like this happen to me, nor have I witnessed anything quite like it. His prayer was simple, but felt genuinely honest and sincere.

On a lighter note, Alyssa and Paige have picked up cross stitching as this is something Alyssa does with her patch on to strengthen her eye. Alyssa is slower than Paige is and sometimes gets discourage because big sister gets things done quicker than she can. So I tend to help out Alyssa so she doesn&#8217;t get as discouraged. Aunt Rudonna told me that one thing to do is to be sure your fingers and hands are clean so as to not dirty up the threads (especially the white thread). Well, the other I came home and Alyssa was getting towards the end of her candy cane pattern (it is a Christmas ornament), and one area of the white thread is now orange-ish &#8230; she had cheese puffs as a snack and didn&#8217;t wash her hands before doing her cross stitch. I absolutely adore her ornament now and I wouldn&#8217;t want it any other way.

As far as updates to her eye exercises, after her regression, she has started to get back on track and just last week she broke her record on the 20/20 walk-away exercise; she made it back to 13 feet 1 inch. Needless to say she was pretty excited about it. Well just tonight she made it back to 13 feet 3 inches, needless to say she was just as excited and wanted to call Momo (Christian&#8217;s mother). I believe her worst day this week was 11 feet 1 inch, which isn&#8217;t terrible.

The point of the topic, if you are wondering, is something the doctor is working with her in getting both eyes working together. What you do is have somebody else hold a straw horizontally, then you take a toothpick and try to insert the toothpick in the straw &#8230; hence &#8216;toothpick in straw&#8217;. Now if you are able to do this with both eyes open, then try it with one eye shut and see how much harder it is. Then try it yet again with a coffee straw (the thin ones), these are the straws they are working with Alyssa on. She is able to do this, but only when both of her eyes are on and working together; which is sometimes, but not majority of the time.
