Alyssa had her regular eye doctor appointment with the optometrist (not the opthamologist). He checked her all out and as we were told six months ago there is nothing physically wrong with her eye, this is something we already knew but I do not believe I have mentioned it too many times on this blog.

I was kind of bummed a little bit when he couldn&#8217;t get her to see any better with the machines than with her glasses. I was hoping he could get her seeing a solid 20/40 maybe even a little better &#8230; okay, okay &#8230; I was really hoping he would put her up on the seat and in just a couple minutes of fiddling around with her prescription, he would be able to get her seeing 20/20. Well that didn&#8217;t happen, but he did make a comment which made me think &#8211; &#8220;Well, this is a good thing; it means we are closing in on the correct prescription for her eye.&#8221;

Looking back on the last few months, Alyssa has made some extremely good progress. We will continue to work towards our goal and God willing, we will cross the finish line.
