Over a year and we haven&#8217;t been given any bad news until yesterday. They have been unable to get both of her eyes working in harmony. Last time I mentioned she was able to use her depth perception, well now they have not been able to get her brain to turn on her left eye now. This is of course dealing without the use of a patch. This is something which really bothers the doctor and they are wanting to try a different time of day for her therapy to see whether or not her eyes are just too tired now that school has started.

So starting Monday (the 15th) we will be having her weekly therapy on Monday mornings at 10am. Christian and I are a little bummed about this, but hopefully in the end all will work out.

Update (Sept. 15th, 2008):Â  Today they were able to get her eyes to both be on and focus together, but the distance was only 4 inches; it is better than nothing.
