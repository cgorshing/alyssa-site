Some people have contacted me regarding an error they have received when attempting to post a comment. I had originally locked down this site to help prevent problems with spam. However, after the logs for this site it does not seem as though we have been found out. So in that case I have released the controls and you should be able to post comments.

I will be sure Alyssa hears them, she is just starting to read right now.
