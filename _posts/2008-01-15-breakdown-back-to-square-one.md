This past Saturday we did our normal exercises and she couldn&#8217;t do anything. When reading the phone numbers, she couldn&#8217;t read a single one. And on the 20/20 walk-away she couldn&#8217;t see the letters at six feet. Christian and I were a little upset, we thought that she just didn&#8217;t want to do them. It was almost 9pm that day, so we continued on and I was going to do them right after lunch on the following day (Sunday).

Well, on Sunday she only read 1 phone number and on the 20/20 walk-away she was down to 4ft. Christian and I were really upset by now. I starting asking Alyssa why she couldn&#8217;t do all the things she was once able to. Come to find out she was actually using her right eye along with her left eye. She had gotten good at hiding it and I guess Christian and I started to get into a comfort zone with her.

I had a long talk with Alyssa on Sunday and I hope she understands now how important this is to her. We just hope it isn&#8217;t too late to correct it now.
