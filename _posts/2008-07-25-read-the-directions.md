When I was younger I had a habit of assuming what my homework wanted me to do. Many times I would be wrong (shocking huh?) and get it all completely wrong. Well we (Christian and I) are in the position where we can not afford to get it wrong with Alyssa. Her weekly sheet which we fill out says at the bottom that any exercise does correctly will most certainly help; however, if done incorrectly it will most certainly cause more harm than good. Well I might have been doing some things wrong.

I have been able to tell for a few months on when Alyssa&#8217;s left eye is off. I have gotten into the habit of asking her to turn her left eye on. I was not paying close attention to her right eye for the fact we have not had any problems with her right eye. Well it turns out she is actually shutting off her right off (somehow) in order to turn her left eye on. Needless to say this is not what we want.

So I have no plans to ever ask this of her again.

Anyways, enough of the bad news and back on track to the good news. Her 20/20 walk away exercise she got back to 12&#8242; 1&#8243; this week using the [new paper][1], so that was wonderful. In case you forgot Friday&#8217;s are our regularly scheduled doctors appointment and as I had [previously reported][2] her VA for a single letter was 20/40 and for a whole line it was 20/70. Well today they told us that for an entire line she got 20/50+2. What the nurse told us is that she read the 50 line fine and was able to read just 2 letters off of the 40 line. My apologies for not know how exactly to write 20/50+2, I read the [Wikipedia][3] article about VA but didn&#8217;t see anything relating to this.

I am hoping the addition of new &#8216;toys&#8217; have helped in this. We bought her a [latch hook][4] rug/kit, and a starter kit for (Aunt Rudonna if you are reading this be forewarned) cross stitching. Paige likes the latch hook so much she wants to get one just for herself, so that will help out &#8230; Alyssa seeing big sister enjoying it, that way it stays as a fun game to do instead of a job.
