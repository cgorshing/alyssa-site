On Alyssa&#8217;s first visit to the ophthalmologist, she received a small finger puppet which she named &#8216;Princess&#8217;. This was used to give her something to focus on while performing her eye exercises. Last week at her appointment the nurse informed us we needed to start using something a little smaller than her finger puppet. Following what the nurse suggested, we took a Sharpie permanent marker, and colored a small circle on the handle. We now use this on the two exercises which require it.

It is a little hard to visualize the difference between these two, so I promise I will take a picture and post them in order to put it into perspective.

Happy Halloween All!
