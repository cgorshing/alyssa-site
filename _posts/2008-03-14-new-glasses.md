We have received Alyssa&#8217;s new glasses and both the Optometrist and Opthamologist have recorded Alyssa&#8217;s VA at 20/80. So just with new glasses it has gone from 20/100 to 20/80. Remember they are only concerned with what her VA is with glasses on, they are not worried about what her VA is with glasses off. So I am hoping this will kick start some more progress.

We also received a new eye exercise last week. Basically what it is doing is allowing some light to penetrate for the right eye (when using the patch, of course no light gets through). So I basically this is the first step in getting both eyes working together.

Her left eye still shuts off when we are not wearing a patch. Most people are confused on how I can tell, well I do this with her patch off because when her patch is on, then her left eye is on the whole time. To help explain this better, when her eye is &#8216;off&#8217; it is in a relaxed position (almost exactly what happens to our eyes when we close our eyes &#8230; you might notice our eyes will turn inward or outward) so I can see her eye turn inwards slightly. I have her look at my nose, and typically her right eye is straight with her left eye turned inward slightly (remember it is off now). Then I cover her right eye with my hand, within about 2 seconds the left eye gets straight &#8230; it just turned on. I then move my hand away from her right eye, most of the time her left eye will stay straight until either she focuses on something else or I have her blink. After either one of these it will turn inward again, this is the brain turning it off.

If this confuses you, then maybe I can demonstrate in person &#8230; which is possible for most family and friends who read this <img src="http://localhost/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

The last bit of goods news is that on her 20/20 walk away exercise she was able to get back to 7ft. 6in. this past week. Which is a record for her, and I am 100% sure she was not cheating. The past three days her percentage for getting letters right was 100% as well, which is fantastic because typically she only gets around 60% correct.

Here is hoping for more progress with the new glasses &#8230; and being the fact they are Barbie glasses, why wouldn&#8217;t there be? <img src="http://localhost/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
