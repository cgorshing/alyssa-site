Just wanted to let everyone know that nothing has changed on the eye exercises, but on her 20/20 walk away tonight she got all the way back to 10ft. 8in. So we are past half way to 20/20! This was another first for her.

Christian and I were very happy &#8230; funny thing is that Alyssa was just as happy, which helps keep her motivation up (okay ours too).
