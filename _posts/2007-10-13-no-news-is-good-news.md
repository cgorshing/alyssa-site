At least that is the way the saying goes. I hope it holds true&#8230;yesterday the nurse didn&#8217;t have a whole lot to report. She just gave us words of encouragement and we went on our way. They will be testing her again next week for her VA, maybe then we will have good news.

Looking over my previous post, I noticed that I haven&#8217;t described her latest and newest addition to the exercises. We tape a sheet of larger print letters on her door in her bedroom, and we have another little card (about 3&#8243; by 3&#8243;) with many numbers and letters. She begins at 16 inches from the sheet, reads one letter (with her patch on of course), then reads a small letter or number (whichever one I choose) from the card. After that she takes a small step backward and repeats the process. Last week she was only able to get about 3-3.5 feet back from the sheet before she couldn&#8217;t read anymore from the sheet. Tonight she was able to read up to 48 inches, at this length she couldn&#8217;t read anymore.

Inches by inches progress is being made.
