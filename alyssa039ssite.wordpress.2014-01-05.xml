		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This weekend hasn't been the best of weekends.  We have started Alyssa on her training/exercies along with putting an eye patch on for three hours a day.  Although today was better than yesterday, she still cries and gets upset with her patch.  So far she seems to handle it well for about one hour, that seems to be her threshold limit.

We did go by Walgreens to look if they had any other eye patches, they did have a $3 one which is slightly different than the one the doctor gave us.  We went ahead and bought just to see if Alyssa would like it any better.  Even though it seems to fit her face a little better, the strap is a little tighter and pushes her glass against her face more.  We have to put the patch on the outside of her glasses because she must keep her glasses on 100% of the time, and the glasses do not fit at all when they are put on top of the patch.

They did have a band-aid type patch which doesn't seem to be too sticky.  Alyssa seems to like this a little better, she doesn't complain (too much) about any pain.

As a family we haven't prayed too much together in the past.  On occasion we will say a prayer during supper time, but that is the limit of our praying.  We started tonight on making it nightly item to do together.  Christian, Paige, and myself said a prayer out loud, but Alyssa said she couldn't think of one to say.  But as I was kissing Paige goodnight, I heard Alyssa say a small one

 "Dear Jesus, please come help me with my eye so I could see better, amen"]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Alyssa has always liked playing hide and go seek.  On Tuesday of this week I thought she came up with a pretty good hiding spot.  I looked in her room and didn't see her, so I went to our other rooms before I finally figured out where she was at ... honestly though, I found her because of her giggling.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When we all got home from work we had a package from <a href="http://www.patchpals.com">PatchPals</a>.  Evidentally, Aubrey (AJ) and Misty bought it for us and had it mailed directly to us.

Christian and I would love to tell them we appreciate the gift so much.  The picture below shows how much Alyssa liked it as well, this was right after I had put it on her.

		<title>A certain exercise is detrimental</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of Alyssa's exercises is to read numbers (if possible) from a sheet of paper.  These look like regular telephone numbers in roughly 16pt. size font.  She uses <a href="http://alyssa.gorshing.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/dscf1448.JPG" title="special glasses">special glasses</a> in addition to her normal glasses.  I hold these special ones right up against her normal glass, they alter the magnification just slightly.  She is suppose to read the numbers once they are clear and following that I am suppose to flip the glasses (again, I only flip the glasses when the numbers are clear).  Initially when we started this exercise they just had her color, which she really enjoys doing.  After a week of coloring they gave us the numbers ('they' being the nurses), they told us that if she can't get the numbers then it would be okay to go back to coloring.  So that is what we have been doing; starting out with the numbers for about one minute, then finishing up with coloring ... since she could never read the numbers.

Our last visit on Friday the 7th, the nurse stressed the point of how important it is for her to be able to read the numbers, and "it would be  detrimental if she can't accomplish this".  That got Christian and I a little scared because we knew how difficult she is having reading the numbers.  All the previous times on that exercise Alyssa almost gets depressed because she is unable to read them.  Last night, Sept. 8th, I didn't even flip the glasses in the five minute span because Alyssa said they were never clear.

Just a few minutes ago we did our exercises, and Alyssa started to read a number right off the bat.  I stopped her thinking that she had memorized the first set of numbers.  I asked if they were clear, and she replied "I can see them, they are clear ... kindof".  At this point, I am tickled pink with a 'kindof clear' response.

I continued on with numerous other numbers and she was about 40% correct on the numbers.  That is kicking butt awesome compared to the 0% previously.

I hope this pattern continues, and I hope she is actually beginning to see things slightly better and that she isn't just pulling my leg ... which she is good at doing to me ... what can I say, I'm a big gullible fool for my girlie's.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My apologies for not posting an update, I have nothing but excuses.

On Sept. 14, the nurse let us know that Alyssa's eye sight has improved.  When we first began our journey a couple months back her vision in her left eye, with glasses on, was 20/300.  This is worse than legally blind (which is 20/200).  In case you are not aware, as I was, of what these numbers mean they basically say that at 20 feet away from Alyssa she can see things that a normal person can see at 300 feet away.  I digress, her vision now is at 20/200. Christian and myself were extremely happy to have a little bit of good news.

On Sept. 21 ... well maybe it is time for a little background.  Hopefully we have all played around with 3D books before.  Were you had to use special glasses with, usually, a blue lens for one eye and a red lens for the other eye.  If you ever tried to close one of you eyes, you didn't get the 3D feel and it looked totally different.  Well this is very similar to how the doctor can check to see how well Alyssa's eyes are working together.  Once they start working together she can see things in a different way than she has historically.  I do not know too much about one of these tests they perform on her, but there is something dealing with a spinning disc.  She has not been able to see it up until this day.  The nurses were pretty excited that when they asked her if she saw anything, she replied "I see something spinning".  The nurses were excited, but nowhere as excited as Christian and I.  You better believe it that we went and ate some ice cream after that visit.

On Sept. 28 we had another good visit.  But I would like to tell you how disgusted I am with other parents in this world.  I know this isn't very christian like, but I am appalled at the number of parents who will make excuses for their children and put the blame on other things and/or other people.  Other parents have had numerous excuses for their child not wearing glasses, not wearing the patch for three hours a day, not performing the excises well, and not doing the exercises at all.  I am at a lost for words on how upset this makes me.  But back to our situation ... the nurse didn't have a whole lot to say but we picked up another exercise.  I asked if the other exercises were not working or causing problems (in case you do not know me too well, I tend to be a pessimistic), the nurse informed us she was finally able to perform this new exercise where she wasn't able to previously.  So another good sign of progress ... no, we didn't get Braums on this visit, we went and bought some big pretzels at the mall.

While typing out the previous paragraph it made me think back a little over a year ago.  I was tucking Alyssa into bed and she let me know that "Daddy, you have a a big belly", "Thanks sugar" I replied basically shocked.  And then she said while stretching hers arms as far apart as she could "It's huuugggeee".  I kind of stumble on how to respond to such a compliment, and then she said the kicker "Yeah, it's big like a pretzel".  Pretzels have never been the same.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today we have some more good news.  The size of the <a href="http://alyssa.gorshing.net/blog/?p=17" title="Numbers Game">numbers</a> in one of her exercises has been decreased starting today.  This, of course, is a good thing.  We don't have much any other information, they tested her <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity" title="Visual Acuity">VA</a> again today and it hasn't changed.  But for the fourth week in a row we have received good news from the doctor.

All is well in the house of the Gorshings.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At least that is the way the saying goes.  I hope it holds true...yesterday the nurse didn't have a whole lot to report.  She just gave us words of encouragement and we went on our way.  They will be testing her again next week for her VA, maybe then we will have good news.

Looking over my previous post, I noticed that I haven't described her latest and newest addition to the exercises.  We tape a sheet of larger print letters on her door in her bedroom, and we have another little card (about 3" by 3") with many numbers and letters.  She begins at 16 inches from the sheet, reads one letter (with her patch on of course), then reads a small letter or number (whichever one I choose) from the card.  After that she takes a small step backward and repeats the process.  Last week she was only able to get about 3-3.5 feet back from the sheet before she couldn't read anymore from the sheet.  Tonight she was able to read up to 48 inches, at this length she couldn't read anymore.

Inches by inches progress is being made.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Alyssa's first visit to the ophthalmologist, she received a small finger puppet which she named 'Princess'.  This was used to give her something to focus on while performing her eye exercises.  Last week at her appointment the nurse informed us we needed to start using something a little smaller than her finger puppet.  Following what the nurse suggested, we took a Sharpie permanent marker, and colored a small circle on the handle.  We now use this on the two exercises which require it.

It is a little hard to visualize the difference between these two, so I promise I will take a picture and post them in order to put it into perspective.

Happy Halloween All!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been meaning to show you all some of the games we play to work with Alyssa's eyes.

<a href="http://gallery.gorshing.net/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&amp;g2_itemId=4131" title="Bean Bag Toss">Bean Bag Toss</a> - We usually this with about three buckets or pots from the kitchen.  I am wanting to make a large board with holes cut in it, kind of like what you see at carnivals.

Flag Toss - Since it is getting dark and colder we aren't able to play this as much as we used to, but hopefully we will still continue to play it throughout the winter during the weekends.  There are a few pictures I thought were good ones ... just try to ignore Fluffy in the background.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://gallery.gorshing.net/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&amp;g2_itemId=4140">Best Sisters</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://gallery.gorshing.net/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&amp;g2_itemId=4146">Alyssa's Turn</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://gallery.gorshing.net/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&amp;g2_itemId=4149">Paige's Turn</a></li>
</ul>
<a href="http://gallery.gorshing.net/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&amp;g2_itemId=4196&amp;g2_navId=xa2ddf532">Chess</a> - I thought Paige a few years ago, and we have started it back up again with teaching Alyssa the rules.  She is getting the basic rules figured out for the pieces, I hate checkers but Christian says she wants to teach Alyssa how to play checkers.

<a href="http://gallery.gorshing.net/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&amp;g2_itemId=4199&amp;g2_navId=xa2ddf532">Go Fish</a> - It is a classic, Alyssa really likes this one.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Our appointment on Friday was pretty good.  The nurse didn't have a whole lot to add.  We haven't changed (added or removed) any exercises, however, the phone numbers she reads for one of her exercises is smaller now.  This size of the font of this new sheet we were given is about the size of the font on a sales receipt.  She has a really hard time reading the numbers, the last sheet she could read about 10 - 14 numbers within 5 minutes.  And now with this new sheet she is reading about 4 - 5 numbers in a minute span.

She reads these numbers with those <a href="http://alyssa.gorshing.net/blog/?p=13">special glasses</a> as I have mentioned before.  She seems to have an easier time with smaller font close up than with larger sized font further away.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Had a decent visit at the doctors office on Friday.  They let us know that she tested at 20/100, if you will recall <a href="http://alyssa.gorshing.net/blog/?p=18">last time</a> she was at 20/200.  They also had us stop doing one of her exercises.  So that is good progress.

But the exercise of reading the numbers with the special glasses, we were given a larger sheet than what we had before.  The reason is that Alyssa is having a too hard of a time reading the smaller numbers.  We have an appointment on Tuesday to discuss with the doctor what all is going on.  Another thing they are having us do is increase the time she has her patch on.  We use the patch for three hours everyday, and now they want to use it for six hours.  They told us they are wanting to try and speed it up so Alyssa won't have to use the patch anymore.

I don't know what they are looking for, but hopefully we will have more questions answered on Tuesday.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Trying to play catch up here ...
<ul>
	<li>We have gone back to the smaller numbers which she reads with the glasses.</li>
	<li>We have picked up a new exercise, the 20/20 walk away.  This is a piece of paper which is used to test people for 20/20 vision.  She started out being able to read the letters at 3.5 ft, we have now worked our (or should I say her) way back to 8ft 9in.</li>
	<li>The time she is wearing her patch has been increased from 3 hours to 6 hours.  Big sister is helping us out a lot in ensuring this happens (Alyssa has to wear it at her day care ... luckily no kids have ridiculed her).</li>
	<li>The games we play are mostly <a href="http://www.perlerbeads.com/">Perler Beads</a> which the doctors office says is a fantastic thing to work with her.  She is also playing games on the computer, most notably is www.webkinz.com ... this has a lot of games where Alyssa has to concentrate on smaller objects and click on them (plus they have addition and subtraction games).</li>
</ul>
We have been given two pieces of some very good new.  First off is the doctors office told us that Alyssa is starting to use her <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macula">macula</a>, for those of you who do not know what this means ... well ... it is a <strong>huge</strong> deal and accomplishment.  The other piece of good news is that starting at the first of January they are planning on working with Alyssa to get both of her eyes working together as a team.

Christian and I are extremely excited about how far she as come and the progress she has made.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We might be getting closer to getting over a hump.  We were told last week at our doctor's visit they are almost to the point of getting Alyssa to work with both her eyes together.

Alyssa did really good on Sunday with her <em>20/20 Walk Away</em> exercise, she passed her old record of 105" and hit 117" which is 3 inches shy of 10ft.

The past week I have noticed her looking around or over her glasses instead of through her glasses, she does this only when her patch is on.  This has not been an issue previously and I am curious of what the problem is.  She is aware she is doing this (she apologizes to me when I catch her doing it), and says she can see much better without her glasses.  I have talked to the nurse about this and hopefully we will have an answer this coming Friday.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This past Saturday we did our normal exercises and she couldn't do anything.  When reading the phone numbers, she couldn't read a single one.  And on the 20/20 walk-away she couldn't see the letters at six feet.  Christian and I were a little upset, we thought that she just didn't want to do them.  It was almost 9pm that day, so we continued on and I was going to do them right after lunch on the following day (Sunday).

Well, on Sunday she only read 1 phone number and on the 20/20 walk-away she was down to 4ft.  Christian and I were really upset by now.  I starting asking Alyssa why she couldn't do all the things she was once able to.  Come to find out she was actually using her right eye along with her left eye.  She had gotten good at hiding it and I guess Christian and I started to get into a comfort zone with her.

I had a long talk with Alyssa on Sunday and I hope she understands now how important this is to her.  We just hope it isn't too late to correct it now.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Our last couple of doctor visits have gone well.  The visit on Feb. 1st better than I anticipated, the nurse let us know that on her telephone numbers, she read them at 16 inches.  This is far better than her normal 6 inches.  I asked the nurse numerous times to ensure I was understanding her correctly.  I also, basically, interrogated Alyssa that she wasn't cheating ... she promised me she did not cheat.

I do have problems getting Alyssa to see anything past a 7-9" mark on her numbers.  She says they are easier at the Doctors office, I have not yet figured out what I am doing wrong.

On the 20/20 walk away she was able to get back to 6ft 6in, but have not been able to go past 5ft 4in lately.

We have some good days and bad days ... but thankfully we have more good days it seems than bad.  And even then, the bad days aren't all that bad.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just a quick update.

During our last office visit the nurse let us know that they are beginning to see Alyssa's eye flash on and off more often.  I asked how they determine this because we aren't able to see anything like that happening.  The nurse told us they have instruments in the office which they are able to use to tell when Alyssa's eye is switching on.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This past week, Christian and I were able to have another sit down (one-on-one ... err ... I guess one-on-two) with Alyssa's doctor.  I have mixed feeling about the meeting, but things are progressing.  Not at the rate we would like, but still progressing nonetheless.  The strangest thing he told us is to not take the home exercises as an indication of well she is progressing along or doing.  He said that a lot of times, kids will not do as good at home because of motivation, sickness, tired, or just plain stubbornness.

He did mention he wanted to get Alyssa back to the regular eye doctor and get a checkup done for her vision and to possibly (hopefully) get a better prescription for her glasses.  He let us know that her VA is still at 20/100, and that hopefully after she gets her new prescription, it might be a little better.

The normal eye doctor appointment was this morning and we are glad to say she was able to see 20/80 with the equipment at the normal eye doctor (optometrist I guess I should be saying).   So Christian and I are extremely excited for her new glasses and prescription to get here next week, hopefully this will help get things moving again.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We have received Alyssa's new glasses and both the Optometrist and Opthamologist have recorded Alyssa's VA at 20/80.  So just with new glasses it has gone from 20/100 to 20/80.  Remember they are only concerned with what her VA is with glasses on, they are not worried about what her VA is with glasses off.   So I am hoping this will kick start some more progress.

<!--more-->

We also received a new eye exercise last week.  Basically what it is doing is allowing some light to penetrate for the right eye (when using the patch, of course no light gets through).  So I basically this is the first step in getting both eyes working together.

Her left eye still shuts off when we are not wearing a patch.  Most people are confused on how I can tell, well I do this with her patch off because when her patch is on, then her left eye is on the whole time.  To help explain this better, when her eye is 'off' it is in a relaxed position (almost exactly what happens to our eyes when we close our eyes ... you might notice our eyes will turn inward or outward) so I can see her eye turn inwards slightly.   I have her look at my nose, and typically her right eye is straight with her left eye turned inward slightly (remember it is off now).  Then I cover her right eye with my hand, within about 2 seconds the left eye gets straight ... it just turned on.  I then move my hand away from her right eye, most of the time her left eye will stay straight until either she focuses on something else or I have her blink.  After either one of these it will turn inward again, this is the brain turning it off.

If this confuses you, then maybe I can demonstrate in person ... which is possible for most family and friends who read this :)

The last bit of goods news is that on her 20/20 walk away exercise she was able to get back to 7ft. 6in. this past week.  Which is a record for her, and I am 100% sure she was not cheating.  The past three days her percentage for getting letters right was 100% as well, which is fantastic because typically she only gets around 60% correct.

Here is hoping for more progress with the new glasses ... and being the fact they are Barbie glasses, why wouldn't there be? :)]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Couple Steps Backward</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We have taken a couple steps backward this past week ... literally.  On the 20/20 walk-away exercise Alyssa is back to 7-8 ft.  She used to be around 5-6ft, so I think her new glasses are helping out a little bit.

<!--more-->

One thing some of you may not be aware of is Alyssa's left eye is basically 'off' when she does not have her patch on.  I explained this a little better in my previous post.  I have tried to explain this to her and she is beginning to tell me when she sees two of things.  This is when both eyes are on but unable to focus together on the subject.  I really do hope she is telling the truth and not just making something up because she knows that is what I want to hear.  Time will tell I guess.  No new exercises this week, we still have the 20/20 walk-away, TV Trainer, Pencil Pursuits, and Temporal Excursions.

One of the neat things I was told about was last Sunday (a week before Easter).  I stood up in church to give my thanks and joys about Alyssa's progress, following church a lady approached me asking more about Alyssa's condition.  She asked if Alyssa had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblyopia">amblyopia</a>, this is one of the five things Alyssa has wrong with her eye.  I informed her it was and we got to talking about the different exercises to help cure it.  She couldn't believe so many of the exercises had changed since her daughter went through the same thing years ago.  I inquired as to the age of her daughter and was told she is 50 years old.  The lady informed me her daughter was basically cured of the problem and is able to drive without any problems.  She also said they started working with her daughter when she was just six years old.  I hope we have the same success story to tell one day.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I haven't written much lately.  This is due to the fact Alyssa hasn't changed much on her exercises or on the progress.

<!--more-->

I have mentioned previously on how Alyssa's left eye is basically 'off' when she does not have her patch on, that the brain is choosing to turn it off because it can not use it.  In Feb. when talked with her doctor, he told us that her eye is starting to flash on.

Recently I have started playing around with her on hopes of getting her eye to come on more.  She can tell when this happens because she sees two of everything (double vision - remember her brain isn't able to use both eyes together, so they are looking at different places).  In the last two weeks she has started telling me when she sees two of things, typically this happens at school.

Just last night I was messing around with her and got her eye turned on (I can tell because her left eye will become straight).  I played with her for roughly 20 minutes and her eye still stayed on.  It was bedtime so I had to stop.

Hopefully her eye will continue to kick on more often.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nothing new to report, Alyssa is holding her own pretty good.

I wanted to ask any of you to either email me (of course phone calls work too) or post a comment to this post as to what ideas you would have for her to play with to help out her eye.

We have just bought a <a href="http://www.hasbro.com/litebrite/">Lite Brite</a>, which she is really liking.  We also have bought her the <a href="http://www.perlerbeads.com/">Perler beads</a>, which she likes also.  The other thing I bought her was a beginners loom.  But this was pretty hard for me to handle (which isn't saying much), so I haven't let play with it too much.

So if you have any ideas of toys/games which would deal with smaller items, or paying attention to details ... please let us know.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I saw those hook rugs the other day and almost bought one.  Hobby Lobby has quite a few and so does Walmart, I haven't found any at our Target.  I might try to find a decent website that sells them and order a few from them.

The problem with just normal coloring books (with crayons) is the pictures are usually pretty big and bold lines.  I have looked quite a few times for a black and white coloring book which has a little more detail.  I would let her use coloring pencils instead of crayons for the fact the coloring pencils are a lot more fine grained than crayons.

The LiteBrite is working pretty well except we keep running out of patterns :)

I also bought <a href="http://www.provocraft.com/products/detail.php?cl=knifty%20knitter&scl=looms&cat=&item=21-0105" rel="nofollow">Knifty Knitter</a>, and it seems a little too hard for her.  Well ... honestly I am trying to learn how to work it so I can teach her; and it keeps making me extremely frustrated.

The only other thing I can think of is doing some cross stitching or possibly braiding some friend braclets.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This <a href="http://alyssa.gorshing.net/blog/?p=31">post</a> is the last time I have given an update on Alyssa's VA.  We were told two weeks ago at our normal appointment her VA was tested but there wasn't any noticeable progress.  We were given an update just last week that I thought I would share with you.

<!--more-->

Alyssa has more of a difficulty seeing letters all ran together, this stems from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblyopia">ambloypia</a> she has (remember this is just one of the five things wrong with her left eye).  The problem is the letters get kind of smudged together and it is difficult for her to distinguish between them.  So with a line full of letters she was able to get to 20/70, which is better than previously stated.

The excellent thing is with a single letter at a time she is able to get to 20/40.  Needless to say this makes Christian and I extremely happy.  I was proud of Christian though; she was able to maintain her composure until we got outside of the doctors office (just to be fair, it took me a few hours before I couldn't contain my joy and had to let it out).  If you recall she started out at 20/400.  To state once again, these measurements are with her glasses on, not with them off.

On her 20/20 walk away exercise she is still staying around 8ft (a little more sometimes), but she is able to read the letters quicker than she was in March.  So during the five minutes we perform the 20/20 walk away exercise she is able to read around 10-14 letters instead of the 4-5 she was reading in March.

One last note - all last week Christian and I were praising her a lot and one night she did really well on 20/20 walk away.  Christian and I (again) praised her for her hard work and told her how proud we are of her.  Her remark was priceless - "God did it mommy."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't write all that often on how much Paige has helped us out and I would like to take a minute and be a proud paw-paw.

<!--more-->

Paige has done wonderfully with helping out with Alyssa.  We usually drop the girls off at day care a little after 7am (we have Alyssa's eye patch on before we leave the house), and the girls ride the bus from there at 8am.  Shortly before the bus arrives, Paige helps Alyssa take her patch off and makes sure her patch is in Alyssa's backpack.  After they get back to day care around 4pm, Paige helps Alyssa get her patch back on.  We have been doing this since August and I believe there has been two days when Paige forgot to put Alyssa's patch on.  This means a tremendous amount to Christian and myself; we are extremely proud of both our girls.

Paige also works with Alyssa on reading, LiteBrite, Chess, and a few other games.

I just wanted to let everybody know that we were not leaving out Alyssa's big sister - she plays an extremely large role in helping us be successful with Alyssa.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just wanted to let everyone know that nothing has changed on the eye exercises, but on her 20/20 walk away tonight she got all the way back to 10ft. 8in.  So we are past half way to 20/20!  This was another first for her.

Christian and I were very happy ... funny thing is that Alyssa was just as happy, which helps keep her motivation up (okay ours too).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As I mentioned in my previous post, Alyssa has surpassed the half way mark.  We test Alyssa on a 8.5" x 11" piece of paper.  This has about 6 columns and 10 rows of letters, with many of them repeated.

Even though Christian and I were extremely happy, we wanted to make sure Alyssa wasn't just memorizing the location of the letters.  So Christian created another sheet and tried to match the font, size, and style of the sheet given to us by Dr. White.  We took the sheet to our weekly appointment just so we have their blessing on using it, which we received.

Alyssa did have a hard time to start off with, getting around 8ft. her first time.  But once she realized all the letters are different and she has to try a little harder, she is back over 10ft. again.

So once again Christian and I are happy with her progress and we have proof Alyssa is not cheating, but is really past a half way mark.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When I was younger I had a habit of assuming what my homework wanted me to do.  Many times I would be wrong (shocking huh?) and get it all completely wrong.  Well we (Christian and I) are in the position where we can not afford to get it wrong with Alyssa.  Her weekly sheet which we fill out says at the bottom that any exercise does correctly will most certainly help; however, if done incorrectly it will most certainly cause more harm than good.  Well I might have been doing some things wrong.

<!--more-->

I have been able to tell for a few months on when Alyssa's left eye is off.  I have gotten into the habit of asking her to turn her left eye on.  I was not paying close attention to her right eye for the fact we have not had any problems with her right eye.  Well it turns out she is actually shutting off her right off (somehow) in order to turn her left eye on.  Needless to say this is not what we want.

So I have no plans to ever ask this of her again.

Anyways, enough of the bad news and back on track to the good news.  Her 20/20 walk away exercise she got back to 12' 1" this week using the <a href="http://alyssa.gorshing.net/blog/?p=39">new paper</a>, so that was wonderful.  In case you forgot Friday's are our regularly scheduled doctors appointment and as I had <a href="http://alyssa.gorshing.net/blog/?p=36">previously reported</a> her VA for a single letter was 20/40 and for a whole line it was 20/70.  Well today they told us that for an entire line she got 20/50+2.  What the nurse told us is that she read the 50 line fine and was able to read just 2 letters off of the 40 line.  My apologies for not know how exactly to write 20/50+2, I read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity">Wikipedia</a> article about VA but didn't see anything relating to this.

I am hoping the addition of new 'toys' have helped in this.  We bought her a <a href="http://www.latchhookrugs.com/">latch hook</a> rug/kit, and a starter kit for (Aunt Rudonna if you are reading this be forewarned) cross stitching.  Paige likes the latch hook so much she wants to get one just for herself, so that will help out ... Alyssa seeing big sister enjoying it, that way it stays as a fun game to do instead of a job.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Year In</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well we have hit a milestone just recently.  Last week we had a year review and had a sit down meeting with the doctor.  He had some good news to tell us, and then some more.  I am actually more excited and relieved than I have been.
<!--more-->
Christian and I had some questions already lined out for the doctor so we have all our questions answered.  One of the most important items, I felt, was are we running out of time.  I am scared to death we will not get this corrected in time and she will be stuck with what she has.  I have been wrong all along in thinking after or near her eighth birthday would basically be the end, whether it was fixed or not.  The doctor informed us it will be more difficult to get progress out of her as she gets older, but we still have a big window of opportunity to get this 100% corrected.  This was something I wasn't expecting and now hearing that I am tremendously excited.

Initially going into this she was diagnosed with six things wrong with her left eye.  One of the items has been totally cured and that is being able to use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macula">macula</a>.  This has been fixed <a href="http://alyssa.gorshing.net/blog/?p=25">some time back</a>, but I wasn't for sure this would completely fix one of the issues she has.  The other problem which is extremely close to being fixed is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblyopia">amblyopia</a>.  We were given some more good news relating to this yesterday.  They tested her VA again and she is down to 20/40.

So now to scare you a little bit ... Alyssa's right eye is beginning to shut off now.  Christian and I asked the doctor about this and to our disbelief he said this was actually a good thing.  What is happening is the brain is so used to shutting off an eye (her left one) out of habit that it is now getting confused which eye to shut off.  This is because her VA in her left eye is getting so much better and the brain is having a hard time decided between the left eye or the right eye.  So as weird as it sounds it is actually a really good thing.  Needless to say we don't want this to happen all the time, but for the time being it is awesome!

The last <strong>huge</strong> news we received is she is starting to have depth perception.  Until recently she has never had this happening.  They have have test to judge your depth perception where you put on glasses and are able to see certain objects 'floating' in air.  She is able to spot two out of the three correctly.  This is a <strong>massive</strong> accomplishment as the brain will start to figure out what all it can do and see with both eyes working together.  Another little side note:  When Alyssa was little I tried to get her to ride a bike without training wheels.  She never was able to do this at all and I never was able to figure it out until we realized what was happening with her eyes.  I feel little wobbly when I walk with one eye closed.  I can only imagine how hard it would be to ride a bike with one eye closed.  So with this progress I am going to go buy her a new bike next month (she is too big for the old one) and see if she can do any better.

One last thing is her exercises are beginning to work with both eyes together instead of just her left.  So far we are doing one hour of working with both eyes together and 10 minutes working only with her left.

She doesn't seem to like her latch hook kit we bought her, but she seems to be really liking the cross stitch starter kit.  Which is actually better as the cross stitch is much smaller to work with.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Alyssa had her regular eye doctor appointment with the optometrist (not the opthamologist).  He checked her all out and as we were told six months ago there is nothing physically wrong with her eye, this is something we already knew but I do not believe I have mentioned it too many times on this blog.

I was kind of bummed a little bit when he couldn't get her to see any better with the machines than with her glasses.  I was hoping he could get her seeing a solid 20/40 maybe even a little better ... okay, okay ... I was really hoping he would put her up on the seat and in just a couple minutes of fiddling around with her prescription, he would be able to get her seeing 20/20.  Well that didn't happen, but he did make a comment which made me think - "Well, this is a good thing; it means we are closing in on the correct prescription for her eye."

Looking back on the last few months, Alyssa has made some extremely good progress.  We will continue to work towards our goal and God willing, we will cross the finish line.]]></content:encoded>

The dedication you two devoted to her eye exercises is something that I'm so very proud of you for.  I know there have been highs and lows but you've always stuck in there for her.  You're teaching her (by showing her) committment and discipline.....&amp; I'm so very proud of you.

I love all of you very much.

		<title>First Bad News</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over a year and we haven't been given any bad news until yesterday.  They have been unable to get both of her eyes working in harmony.  Last time I mentioned she was able to use her depth perception, well now they have not been able to get her brain to turn on her left eye now.  This is of course dealing without the use of a patch.  This is something which really bothers the doctor and they are wanting to try a different time of day for her therapy to see whether or not her eyes are just too tired now that school has started.

So starting Monday (the 15th) we will be having her weekly therapy on Monday mornings at 10am.  Christian and I are a little bummed about this, but hopefully in the end all will work out.

Update (Sept. 15th, 2008):  Today they were able to get her eyes to both be on and focus together, but the distance was only 4 inches; it is better than nothing.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Toothpick In Straw</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When all goes well I find it extremely easy to praise and brag about the progress Alyssa has made.  But when she doesn't do all that well, I don't seem to speak up as much; in that regard I apologize for not posting anything in almost two months.

Alyssa did regress quit a bit, we aren't sure why this happened but it did and we are dealing with it.  I won't get into the details of taking steps backward, but rather to focus on the brighter side of things.

The one thing I would like to say publicly is my appreciate of my in-laws.  On Sept. 27th Christian's family had a get together for her grandmothers 80th birthday.  We all had fun riding a go-cart, throwing a football, shooting a bow and arrow (I thought I lost an arrow, but Paige found it for me), singing some horrible karaoke (well, the bad part was due to me), and some good pork tenderloins.

Near the end though, we all came together and prayed for Alyssa.  Shannon McAbee was nice enough to say a few nice things since I was unable to contain my composure.  We all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laying_on_of_hands">laid hands</a> on her with Olive Oil and prayed.  I truly appreciate everybody participating in it, that meant a tremendous amount to both Christian and I.

Along those same lines, a few weeks ago we were in <a href="http://www.citybites.net/">City Bites</a> (a sandwich place in Okla.) eating lunch on Saturday.  The girls got up to refill our drinks and a customer noticed Alyssa's patch, he stopped Paige and asked what was wrong with Alyssa's eye.  While he and his wife were leaving they stopped by our table and the gentleman struck up a conversation with Alyssa.  Now most of you know Alyssa is not an outgoing type person and I was just so proud of her that she actually answered his questions.  The quick conversation the gentleman and Alyssa had is as follows:

Gentleman: Do you believe in Jesus?
Alyssa: Yeah.
Gentleman: Do you believe that he can do all things?
Alyssa: Yes.
Gentleman: Would you like to hold my hand and pray with me?

Alyssa didn't say anything, she looked up at me and Christian for acknowledgment, and after we told her it was okay, she took his hand and he began to pray for her.

I hadn't ever had something like this happen to me, nor have I witnessed anything quite like it.  His prayer was simple, but felt genuinely honest and sincere.

On a lighter note, Alyssa and Paige have picked up cross stitching as this is something Alyssa does with her patch on to strengthen her eye.  Alyssa is slower than Paige is and sometimes gets discourage because big sister gets things done quicker than she can.  So I tend to help out Alyssa so she doesn't get as discouraged.  Aunt Rudonna told me that one thing to do is to be sure your fingers and hands are clean so as to not dirty up the threads (especially the white thread).  Well, the other I came home and Alyssa was getting towards the end of her candy cane pattern (it is a Christmas ornament), and one area of the white thread is now orange-ish ... she had cheese puffs as a snack and didn't wash her hands before doing her cross stitch.  I absolutely adore her ornament now and I wouldn't want it any other way.

As far as updates to her eye exercises, after her regression, she has started to get back on track and just last week she broke her record on the 20/20 walk-away exercise; she made it back to 13 feet 1 inch.  Needless to say she was pretty excited about it.  Well just tonight she made it back to 13 feet 3 inches, needless to say she was just as excited and wanted to call Momo (Christian's mother).  I believe her worst day this week was 11 feet 1 inch, which isn't terrible.

The point of the topic, if you are wondering, is something the doctor is working with her in getting both eyes working together.  What you do is have somebody else hold a straw horizontally, then you take a toothpick and try to insert the toothpick in the straw ... hence 'toothpick in straw'.  Now if you are able to do this with both eyes open, then try it with one eye shut and see how much harder it is.  Then try it yet again with a coffee straw (the thin ones), these are the straws they are working with Alyssa on.  She is able to do this, but only when both of her eyes are on and working together; which is sometimes, but not majority of the time.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[That toothpick in the straw demonstration was an eye-opening experience (no pun intended).  It's interesting that each eye gets a different response.  If you remember when you did this to me, I got close to putting the toothpick in the straw using one eye, but with the other, I was several inches away.  Why is that?]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Our Journey Is Over.. For Now</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As of last week our journey is over.  Alyssa has come a tremendous distance and accomplished wonderful things.

Christian and I are very grateful for everything our friends and family have done for us, and we wanted to extend our appreciation for you all.

Alyssa's eye sight is still not 100%, but most of the time both of her eyes focus on the same thing and her VA in her left eye is staying pretty solid at 20/30.  Unbelievable.

It has already been a strange adjustment getting back to so-called 'normal' as it seems strange not having to worry about patching her right eye for six hours a day and also not to worry about doing exercises.  Dr. White does not want us to do anything with her eye anymore.  Instead of a yearly eye checkup with her normal eye doctor, we will schedule it at a six month interval.  We will also stop in Dr. White's office for a checkup from time to time as well.  But he does not expect anything to regress (God willing).  As a parting gift they gave Alyssa the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Junie-Jones-Graduation-Girl-No/dp/0375802924">Junie B. Jones Is a Graduation Girl</a> book and everybody who had worked with her signed it.

This will probably be my last post for some time.  Once again, Christian and I are extremely blessed to have the friends and family in our lives.

Thank you all]]></content:encoded>
