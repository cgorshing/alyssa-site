I have been meaning to show you all some of the games we play to work with Alyssa&#8217;s eyes.

[Bean Bag Toss][1] &#8211; We usually this with about three buckets or pots from the kitchen. I am wanting to make a large board with holes cut in it, kind of like what you see at carnivals.

Flag Toss &#8211; Since it is getting dark and colder we aren&#8217;t able to play this as much as we used to, but hopefully we will still continue to play it throughout the winter during the weekends. There are a few pictures I thought were good ones &#8230; just try to ignore Fluffy in the background.

  * [Best Sisters][2]
  * [Alyssa&#8217;s Turn][3]
  * [Paige&#8217;s Turn][4]

[Chess][5] &#8211; I thought Paige a few years ago, and we have started it back up again with teaching Alyssa the rules. She is getting the basic rules figured out for the pieces, I hate checkers but Christian says she wants to teach Alyssa how to play checkers.

[Go Fish][6] &#8211; It is a classic, Alyssa really likes this one.
