Just a quick update.

During our last office visit the nurse let us know that they are beginning to see Alyssa&#8217;s eye flash on and off more often. I asked how they determine this because we aren&#8217;t able to see anything like that happening. The nurse told us they have instruments in the office which they are able to use to tell when Alyssa&#8217;s eye is switching on.

Christian and I have been unable to see this occurring at home, but hopefully we will soon.
