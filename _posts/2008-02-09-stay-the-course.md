Our last couple of doctor visits have gone well. The visit on Feb. 1st better than I anticipated, the nurse let us know that on her telephone numbers, she read them at 16 inches. This is far better than her normal 6 inches. I asked the nurse numerous times to ensure I was understanding her correctly. I also, basically, interrogated Alyssa that she wasn&#8217;t cheating &#8230; she promised me she did not cheat.

I do have problems getting Alyssa to see anything past a 7-9&#8243; mark on her numbers. She says they are easier at the Doctors office, I have not yet figured out what I am doing wrong.

On the 20/20 walk away she was able to get back to 6ft 6in, but have not been able to go past 5ft 4in lately.

We have some good days and bad days &#8230; but thankfully we have more good days it seems than bad. And even then, the bad days aren&#8217;t all that bad.
